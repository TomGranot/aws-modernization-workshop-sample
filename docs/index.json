	"content": " Building a workshop leverages several tools:\n Git Hugo Hugo learn theme CloudFormation templates  1. Clone Sample Repo AWS Modernization Workshops are powered by the Hugo Framework. Hugo uses markdown files to generate HTML assets so if your experts have experience with writing documentations on GitHub README\u0026rsquo;s, this should be very familiar!\nIf not, that is also OK as there are a plethora of documentations to help out someone just starting.\nTo make the creation of web page documentation easier, we utilize a tool called Hugo. You will write your documentation/instructions using Markdown language and Hugo will create static HTML content that can be served via S3. Hugo additionally applies a theme so that the site will have an AWS look and feel plus add additional features to beautify and make content stand out.\n Start by cloning the base repo and push it to a repo on your own GitHub account. Change the name of myCompany-Workshop :)\ngit clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-workshop-base myCompany-Workshop  We use clone instead of fork as you will break this from the sample repo and change the name. Once approved and published the repo will be called something to the effect aws-modernization-workshop-with-Company_Name\n 2. Download submodules The repo uses git submodules so run the following commands at the root of the newly cloned repo:\ngit submodule init git submodule update The submodules contain the hugo-theme-learn theme for the Hugo Framework. For more information about hugo-theme-learn used in AWS Workshops, visit https://learn.netlify.com/en/\n 3. Create and push to YOUR GitHub repo Create a repo in your GitHub account and follow the instructions under \u0026ldquo;Push an existing repository from the command line\u0026rdquo;\n4. Install Hugo If you\u0026rsquo;re using a Mac, go to your terminal:\nbrew install hugo If you\u0026rsquo;re using a Window, go to your command line:\nchoco install hugo -confirm For more information about installing and using Hugo, visit https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/\n 5. Running Hugo From within the root of the repo\n$ hugo server Using a browser go to http://localhost:1313 to view the site. Hugo is dynamic, so as you edit the content, and the page in the browser will change. Allowing you to view in real-time what the content will look like.\n"

	"content": " Think about what you want to accomplish and how you want to educate users about your product. What is the use case or problem that your product solves for the end user and develop a story around it. Three things to have in the back of your mind while you think about this:\n Customers don\u0026rsquo;t buy products, they buy solutions to their problems. So again, think about the problem/use case your solution solves. Work backwards from that. Make learning fun, have a nice story that can entertain them while educating them at the same time. We have all sat through those boring click and paste workshops, don\u0026rsquo;t make yours one of them. While you are an expert in your field/solution, others are not. Build content that adds context, explain concepts, and tie it back to your overall story.  Build new or use an existing workshop? This decision will come down to the story you are trying to tell. If your product or solution is a simple integration to a bigger product or story, then you might want to consider building upon an existing workshop. If you have a full story to tell or there is no existing workshop that fits your need, then it\u0026rsquo;s best to create your own stand-alone workshop.\nWorkshops are meant to evolve, so a good story will be extended by other partners, SAs, and the public. The workshop is open source, therefore allowing it to grow.\n Examples of some existing workshops  https://snyk.awsworkshop.io/ https://newrelic-serverless.awsworkshop.io https://circleci.awsworkshop.io/ https://eksworkshop.com https://cdkworkshop.com  Workshops can be built by multiple partner solutions that benefits each other!

Hugo uses the content stored in content to build web pages. If you look under the directory there is a file _index.md. This is the starting point of the documentation and is the equivalent of index.html. Each folder becomes the high level navigation. Each of the folders and files are prefixed with a number, which is there for visual ordering only and does not have an effect on the actual html or workshop order.\nStart with /content/_index.md Each file has what Hugo calls front matter. This is basically metadata that Hugo uses when generating the files. Here is an example, note the Title and weight fields. Weight controls the ordering, lower number the higher the order. Front matter weight is what actually orders the content in Hugo, prefixing numbers to files such as 1_my_content.md is only for visual ordering in your IDE/directory listing.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Main Page\u0026#34; chapter: true weight: 1 --- Edit The title and the text below the 3 dashes, now Save If everything went well the browser should refresh with the changes you have just make.\nEdit folder names and files The folder names are stubs and should be edited to make clear what type of content is stored in them. The file _index.md within each folder sets the order using the weight front matter, and the name that appears in the left navigation pane. Once again names are prefixed with a number only to visually sort, the weight is what really determines the ordering.\nWhen creating additional sections or pages, copy the files and folders from another section, rename and edit.\n Samples and building blocks In the repo https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modernization-workshop-sample there are several examples and content that you can copy and reuse in your workshop.\n Content directory: various building blocks such as an account and Cloud9 instance. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget the images in static/images Code-samples directory is CloudFormation, CodeBuild, and other samples. The CloudFormation folder is available publicly at https://modernization-workshop-bucket.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cfn/ so you can leverage existing templates for nesting and one-click deployments.  Feel free to leverage these samples in your solution. Note this is a workshop so samples are not meant to be best practice, but more for educational purposes only. So if your workshop uses an RDS instance there is no reason to setup replication, backups, and everything else that goes along with making a robust solution, this is of course unless your workshop is on building robust fault tolerant solutions ;)\nScripts, Artifacts, custom CloudFormation templates If your workshop includes custom scripts, artifacts, etc\u0026hellip; you should save them to the content folder where they will be needed. As an example, if I have a getting_started.sh that is used in the First Section, I would place that script in content/10_first_section\nSpecial markdown samples  Markdown cheat sheet https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet Learn theme markdown https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/markdown/ Menu extras and shortcuts https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/menushortcuts/ Using Font Awesome Emoji\u0026rsquo;s  https://learn.netlify.app/en/cont/icons/ to help your page pop   "

What better way to learn than to let customers get hands on with building or instrumenting products or services in an actual AWS environment? A workshop format is used because it scales well, meaning you can deliver the content and message whenever and wherever the customer happens to be: whether the customer is at work, home, or at an AWS event, they can get hands on and learn about building products and solutions.\n"

	"content": " High Level Workshop Planning  Determine what problem/use case your solution solves.  Remember to wrap your story around this so customers find it useful. For example: I want potential customers to learn how easy it is to instrument our testing product into their build pipeline.  Determine what concepts about your solution you want the customers to learn about. Think from a high level what components or systems will be needed. These are the building blocks that will save you time when you start to build the workshop. Don\u0026rsquo;t re-invent the wheel. Link to content for account creation and other artifacts you will need. This also goes for applications such as Unicorn store, Java Pet Shops, Wild Rydes, etc\u0026hellip;@James I think we should remove this line Think about what AWS services that you\u0026rsquo;ll need for your workshop.  Are you a Kubernetes management/CD partner? You\u0026rsquo;ll probably need an EKS cluster in your customer\u0026rsquo;s account. Is your CI/CD solution completely abstracted and requires permissions to automate the provisioning and management of the pipeline? You\u0026rsquo;ll probably need AWS access keys.  Determine the workflow or stages.  You are telling a story, which means:  An introduction section that details what problem you\u0026rsquo;ll be solving and what the customers will accomplish with the workshop The educational body of the workshop (separated into modules) The conclusion that ties all the pieces together.   Don\u0026rsquo;t forget a cleanup section as well. Customers will be deploying AWS resources, and we want to make sure they are not charged more than what is necessary to learn about your solution. Identify what event this workshop will be presented at. Will it be AWS hosted, partner-instructed event? Or will it be marketed as a self-paced workshop?  This is important as it will change the flow/set-up instructions. i.e. using Event Engine (more about this later) at an AWS hosted event with pre-provisioned infrastructure  Have a way to capture leads! This is the end goal.  Workshop Planning Best Practices  Thought about all the above? Write it down in an abstract to send to your PSA for review! Creating a GREAT workshop takes a lot of effort - the individuals involved will spend a combined 30+ hours on researching, writing, testing, revising the workshop.  Another way of saying: there should be significant buy-in via dedicated experts to see this project end-to-end.  Create the content well in advance of the date of when the workshop will be launched.  Trying to create a workshop 4 weeks before a launch/target date means an all-hands on deck situation. Lots of unnecessary stress due to a tight deadline. The PSA involved will pull the plug if the quality of the workshop is compromised so give yourself breathing room by doing this in advance.  Test your workshop as you create it - the things you\u0026rsquo;re figuring out in the last module won\u0026rsquo;t mean anything if the first module doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. Keep your PSA/PDM involved throughout the process - we\u0026rsquo;re all in this together and AWS wants you to succeed.  "

	"content": " Additional editing tips  Use Cloud9 for the IDE and workshop host for all participants. Having users setup their local workstations doesn\u0026rsquo;t work very well and often contributes to a poor user experience. Review the flow of other workshops. To create a new page, copy another document and rename it. The name is only important to the builders, but the actual name that shows in the navigation is the title at the top of the document.\n If you want to create a new page between 10 and 20 you can use any number in the name as long as it\u0026rsquo;s sequentially between 10 and 20. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to appropriately set the weight in the top section. Place all images in {repo_root}/static/images. There are several examples of using images in the sample content. Provide users with sample output in \u0026lt;pre\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; tags so that the copy to clipboard function is not there. No reason to copy example output to the clipboard. DO NOT assume that the user has any exposure to AWS or your product. Everything needs to be explained and all command or areas in the UI you want the user to go to needs to be provided. Screen shots or examples work well for this, especially on busy UI\u0026rsquo;s.\n Use an architecture diagram in your workshop. Show people what are going to deploy. Visuals work wonders when educating people about abstract concepts.\n  "

	"content": " Self-Paced Workshops Self-Paced Workshops can be facilitated in different ways, such as the AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series or having partners simply direct customers to these workshops from their webpage. Again, the benefit of creating these workshops allow anyone to go through it, whether it\u0026rsquo;s a marketed event or not. These workshops require the attendees to either have their own AWS account or create one. There will need to be instructions on how to provision certain services such as EKS clusters or databases but as it is self-paced, the attendee can complete the workshop at their leisure.\nSelf-Paced Workshops are also another reason why contextualizing each part of the workshop is so important. There isn\u0026rsquo;t anyone to answer questions so there must be enough information either in the workshop or references to documentation for the attendees to learn on their own.\nAWS Hosted Events AWS Hosted Events can also come in different forms: Dev Day, Re:Invent workshop sessions, or simply part of a partner\u0026rsquo;s series of workshops. The common factor in any of these events is utilizing Event Engine, a tool developed internally at AWS that provisions as many as 100 AWS accounts for workshop attendees to use. These accounts can be programmed to provision infrastructure so that there is no wait time for the attendees. They can dive into the core of the workshop and learn the concepts of the partner solutions. Best of all, it comes at no cost to the attendees and are shut off at a pre-determined time, making it the perfect digital sandbox to learn about a partner\u0026rsquo;s solution and experimenting with different features as the attendees become more familiar as a by-product of attending the workshop.\nThese events are also staffed by both AWS Partner Solution Architects and Partners\u0026rsquo; technical experts for a live instructor-led session to walk through the workshop, answering questions from the audience as well as expounding on more of the cool features both for AWS services and the partner solutions.\n"

	"title": "FAQs",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " FAQ\u0026rsquo;s Why do you use Cloud9?\nAnswer: When conducting workshops it is often difficult to determine the state of the users workstation and validate that all dependencies and requirements are installed. With Cloud9 we get a capable IDE and shell access to the AWS account. Git, aws-cli, programming languages, and many other tools are pre-installed which allows us to start everyone from a known state and not have to fumble around with missing components from someone\u0026rsquo;s workstation.\nCan I change the License?\nAnswer: We rather you not. The site will be posted at aws-samples and the license included in the sample is MIT, which is meant to be simple and open source friendly.\nWhat if I want to use other tools, such as Jenkins or Terraform as examples?\nAnswer: Great. We actually encourage you to use other tools and services as you may expect customers to use this in their environment. Note that if you choose to use additional or alternative tools that it\u0026rsquo;s easy for the end user to follow and does not detract from your main message. As an example, if your main message is application security scanning, does it make a difference whether you use Jenkins or CodeBuild, or does the usage of one, or the other add unnecessary complexity that has nothing to do with your message? So don\u0026rsquo;t reinvent the wheel and if there is already an example of instrumenting testing in CodeBuild, I would use that as the tool has nothing to do with your message. But if your main message is instrumenting security scanning on Jenkins, then yes, use Jenkins.\nHow long does a workshop take to create?\nAnswer: As little as 3 days and as long as 2 months. If the workshop creator is familiar with git, markdown, and AWS the content can be created in as little as 3 days, which includes testing out the workshop flow. If the user is not familiar with some of these tools, there is a learn curve they will need to overcome. Additionally, dedication also plays a factor. To complete the workshop in 3 days requires full dedication. If someone is splitting time with their \u0026ldquo;day job\u0026rdquo; and workshop creation then it can be expected to take longer.\nWhat skill level are workshop participants?\nAnswer: The spectrum varies from not familiar to experts. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume workshop participants are familiar with AWS and you should include links to areas of the console you want the user to navigate to.\nHow long should a workshop be?\nAnswer: The typical length of a workshop should be around ~2 hours to complete. We have noticed that if it takes any more time the user will lose interest, and you may have a problem with drop-outs. If your content is longer than 2 hours, consider breaking it up into multiple modules.\nTip: If breaking up into multiple modules, create a flow that participants can start up a new module without having to go back through previous modules again. This allows workshop users to take breaks that may span days between modules. This is typically accomplished by automating steps the participant followed in previous modules.\n"
