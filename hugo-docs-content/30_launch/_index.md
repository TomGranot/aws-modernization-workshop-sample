## Launch

With your workshop published, now it's time to set up some GTM (Go to Market) activities: 

* Notify your PDR or PDM that you have a workshop launched
* Post a link on your main page
* Share on social media your workshop
* Schedule events to deliver your workshop
* Work with AWS Partner Marketing for some additional GTM activities

Unless AWS has a program to market these workshops, such as the AWS Marketplace DevOps Series, the bulk of the marketing work will be on the **partner's marketing and sales team**. There are available marketing funds that can be used, but the outreach and getting registrants is still on the partner. AWS can help with retweets as well as adding the partner event landing page on specific sites such as the Dev Day website.
