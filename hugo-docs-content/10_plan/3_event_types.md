### Self-Paced Workshops
Self-Paced Workshops can be facilitated in different ways, such as the [AWS Marketplace DevOps Workshop Series](https://pages.awscloud.com/awsmp-h2-dev-aws-marketplace-devops-workshop-series.html) or having partners simply direct customers to these workshops from their webpage. Again, the benefit of creating these workshops allow anyone to go through it, whether it's a marketed event or not. These workshops require the attendees to either have their own AWS account or create one. There will need to be instructions on how to provision certain services such as EKS clusters or databases but as it is self-paced, the attendee can complete the workshop at their leisure. 

Self-Paced Workshops are also another reason why contextualizing each part of the workshop is so important. There isn't anyone to answer questions so there must be enough information either in the workshop or references to documentation for the attendees to learn on their own.

### AWS Hosted Events
AWS Hosted Events can also come in different forms: [Dev Day](https://aws.amazon.com/events/devday/), Re:Invent workshop sessions, or simply part of a partner's series of workshops. The common factor in any of these events is utilizing Event Engine, a tool developed internally at AWS that provisions as many as 100 AWS accounts for workshop attendees to use. These accounts can be programmed to provision infrastructure so that there is no wait time for the attendees. They can dive into the core of the workshop and learn the concepts of the partner solutions. Best of all, it comes at no cost to the attendees and are shut off at a pre-determined time, making it the perfect digital sandbox to learn about a partner's solution and experimenting with different features as the attendees become more familiar as a by-product of attending the workshop.

These events are also staffed by both AWS Partner Solution Architects and Partners' technical experts for a live instructor-led session to walk through the workshop, answering questions from the audience as well as expounding on more of the cool features both for AWS services and the partner solutions.
