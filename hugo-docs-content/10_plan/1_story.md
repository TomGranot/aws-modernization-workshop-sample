Think about what you want to accomplish and how you want to educate users about your product.  What is the use case or problem that your product solves for the end user and develop a story around it. Three things to have in the back of your mind while you think about this: 

1. Customers don't buy products, they buy solutions to their problems. So again, think about the problem/use case your solution solves. Work backwards from that.
1. Make learning fun, have a nice story that can entertain them while educating them at the same time. We have all sat through those boring click and paste workshops, don't make yours one of them.
1. While you are an expert in your field/solution, others are not. Build content that adds context, explain concepts, and tie it back to your overall story.

### Build new or use an existing workshop?
This decision will come down to the story you are trying to tell. If your product or solution is a simple integration to a bigger product or story, then you might want to consider building upon an existing workshop. If you have a full story to tell or there is no existing workshop that fits your need, then it's best to create your own stand-alone workshop.

Workshops are meant to evolve, so a good story will be extended by other partners, SAs, and the public. The workshop is open source, therefore allowing it to grow.
